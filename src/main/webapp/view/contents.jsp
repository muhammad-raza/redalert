 <h2 id="money_laundering_crimes">Section 1 - Money Laundering Crimes</h2>

 <p>Section 1 starts by looking at each of the predicate offences to money laundering, recognizing that whilst the motive for economic crime, for money, may be similar there are many differences that set each of these crimes apart and make them attractive to criminals. For each, a look back through time provides the context in which to place criminal activities and relevant statistics aim to show the scale and size of the prots earned by the criminals, why criminals find these crimes so attractive and how criminals launder their money.</p>
