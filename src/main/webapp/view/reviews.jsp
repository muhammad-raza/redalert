	<div itemprop="reviewBody"><img class="comma_open" src="/images/comma_open.png">"John Cusack's Red Alert" deserves to become the global standard textbook on AML and CFT for banking practitioners compliance officers as well as regulators and academics. This is the first publication on the subject written by a true professional and an experienced senior AML practitioner John's "Red Alert" accumulates the collective knowledge of some of the best compliance officers of our generation. Reflecting 20 plus years of professional insight and responsibility the book can give profound and practical guidance to experts and shared experience to new joiners. The collection of facts and cases is unique. Everybody should read the introductory five recommendations to "Effectively" combat Money Laundering which sounds like John's message that if we want to win the fight against financial crime all of us have to think about and decide on fundamental changes to the current approach which has come to its limits and, at least partially, failed to achieve what it was originally intended for. Time has come for unbiased reviews and to develop a far more integrated approach. This core message alone and the considerations and facts that lead to it make this book compulsory reading for all those who count in the industry. A great achievement. Congratulations.<img class="comma_close" src="/images/comma_close.png"></div>

	<div itemprop="reviewBody"><img class="comma_open" src="/images/comma_open.png">Anti-money laundering efforts, both in the prosecution of those engaged in the illicit activities, as well as financial institutions, who are at the forefront of the fight to keep illicit funds from flowing through the financial sector, has become increasingly complex. Attempting to understand all of the potential risks, as well as possible avenues to prevent money laundering and related financial crimes, also has become quite difficult. John's book Red Alert, is an excellent and comprehensive compilation of existing risks and potential solutions, with detailed narratives on how to effectively implement them. In addition, John has included a significant number of summaries of actual cases, which provide an excellent framework for anyone truly interested in understanding the root cause of some significant money laundering incidents. Understanding how money laundering has occurred, is necessary in order to identify and implement meaningful solutions. While others may have been able to research and bring together some of this information, no one is more uniquely qualified than John to bring together all relevant information in one publication. This is a book that will serve as a primary reference for most things money laundering and financial crime related.<img class="comma_close" src="/images/comma_close.png"></div>

	<div itemprop="reviewBody"><img class="comma_open" src="/images/comma_open.png">John Cusack is one of the "elders" of the Anti-Money Laundering compliance community. He witnessed the emergence of the discipline more than 20 years ago and he has occupied a leading role in the evolution of the practice of AML compliance ever since. I just wish he looked his age like the rest of us! In Red Alert, John has done the anti-money laundering compliance community and anyone interested in the global fight against financial and organised crime a great service. His book is a valuable resource for practitioners and anyone interested in learning about the origins, challenges and current practice of global AML compliance. Red Alert also provides thoughtful and provocative ideas and concrete proposals to advance the goal of global anti-money laundering law: the interdiction of the vast market in criminal proceeds derived from organised crime, corruption and a wide range of financial crimes. As anyone working in the field of anti-money laundering compliance knows the pace and scale of regulatory AML enforcement against financial institutions has reached historic levels and has been sustained for longer than ever before. AML and financial crime have become significant operational risks for financial institutions throughout the world. John has provided a resource that I predict will find a comfortable place on the bookshelves or e-book devices of compliance officers all over the World.<img class="comma_close" src="/images/comma_close.png"></div>

	<div itemprop="reviewBody"><img class="comma_open" src="/images/comma_open.png">For many years now the fight against financial crime and the detection of the proceeds of such activities has been one of the major challenges facing the financial markets. Increasingly financial institutions, financial centres, regulators and governments themselves are at risk of severe reputational damage if they fail to detect such activity. Individuals are also at risk of public censure or worse if they fail to instigate systems and controls to combat the risk of money laundering the proceeds of crime and to prevent their organisation being used by criminals and terrorists. Against this background John Cusack's book is very timely. I do not think anybody is better qualified to address this topic, he has been at the forefront of the fight against financial crime for most of his career and his wisdom and practical approach is very evident throughout. I commend this book to those working in the financial services industry, to the lawyers and compliance personnel who work with them and of course to their regulators, law enforcement agencies and policy makers.<img class="comma_close" src="/images/comma_close.png"></div>

	<div itemprop="reviewBody"><img class="comma_open" src="/images/comma_open.png">John Cusack offers the reader an insight into a world which is unfortunately only too real, though one many rarely see in any event with up front clarity and precision drawing from his many years of experience. UBS is only one of many stakeholders who can help in the fight to combat money laundering, a fight that John rightly identified requires still much greater focus on effectiveness and more resourceful co-operation between public and private parties. This at a time when co-operation and trust evidently requires renewed investment. We need to always remember that TRUST IS THE SUM OF ALL PROMISES. Accordingly John lays bare the harms and very significant threats we all face in not working together and in allowing trust to wither. I thank all readers to take this to heart.<img class="comma_close" src="/images/comma_close.png"></div>

With only a 1% detection rate, the waron financial crime, drug dealing and terrorism has a long way to go. Just one example from the many John identifies: although the former President Marcos of the Philippines is believed to have stolen $5 billion to $10 billion from the country, and yet some 28 years later, less than $700 million has been recovered To prevent crime, criminals need to know that crime does not pay. Money, and the flow of money through banks and other institutions and corporates, is the life blood of crime Hence the need for strong and effective global anti-money laundering programmes. John's book will undoubtedly become the "go to" reference work for anyone involved in anti-money laundering procedures and the wider fraud community of professionals. This is deservedly so, as it is well researched, well evidenced and of enor- mous breadth and depth. John is to be congratulated for his determination and stamina in completing such a work.<img class="comma_close" src="/images/comma_close.png"></div>

Ever the trooper, Matt started, his unique experience, style and flair for sharing knowledge shining through; but he didn't get around to finishing it either. When Matt passed away, three years ago already, John, demonstrating the drive, dedication and determination which make him who he is, picked up the pen (or rather iPad), and, with the support of many, but as always leading the charge, finished what Matt had started.
