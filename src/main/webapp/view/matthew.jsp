            <p>On 29 March 2011 we lost Matthew Cooper, known to many in the world of money laundering prevention as one of its most dedicated students and gifted teachers. To quote from the website established in memory to Matt,</p>

            <p><img class="comma_open" src="/images/comma_open.png">the AML community lost one of its most knowledgeable and colourful members, someone who was universally liked and respected, a rare feat in our business.<img class="comma_close" src="/images/comma_close.png"></p>

            <p>Matt had worked in both public (for the UK government in many roles, including fraud prevention at the sharp end and in the civil service at the smart end) and with the private sector with Barclays as Group AML Head and as deputy Global AML Head at UBS and then latterly at AMEX. Matt had also been one of the most influential and dedicated contributors to the Wolfsberg Group as well as with other industry bodies championing and always working together to find common solutions and practical ways to move things forward. In all of these roles, Matt was infectious and passionate about his work but also had time for colleagues and would listen and provide experienced and wise counsel whenever it was needed or whenever it was sought.</p>

            <p>To many Matt will always be a friend; one sorely missed but whose lasting contributions reminds of his gifts and his unique talents. This book was inspired together with Matt Cooper and it is also for this reason that I dedicate this book to his memory.</p>
