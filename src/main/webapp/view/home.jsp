<p>This Book is intended to serve as a comprehensive source of information for money laundering professionals that wish to better understand, establish or improve their money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, sanctions, bribery and corruption prevention frameworks (hereafter referred to as money laundering). These issues are of utmost importance and increasingly so, as the international community is relying on money laundering professionals to assist in successfully preventing, detecting and reporting money laundering in order to fight the devastating economic and social consequences of these criminal activities.</p>

<p>No Financial Institution worthy of its license, and mindful of its reputation and the risks, both criminal and civil that exist will deal knowingly with the proceeds of crime. More than that a financial institution will want to assist government authorities in every way in disrupting criminal funds, interdicting criminal flows and gathering intelligence to follow criminal trails. In addition to following the requirements by anti money laundering standard setters, as presented for compliance by applicable laws and regulations, Financial Institutions are faced with the challenge of designing appropriate AML Programmes which respond not only to the law, but should be based on the financial institutions own business activities but also reflect the changing threats posed by criminals and terrorists, to societies priorities championed by various stakeholders and to the pace of change within the Financial Services Industry.</p>

<p>This challenge is not all straightforward and requires a profound understanding of criminal behavior, the actors themselves, their criminal activities and in particular their attitudes and methods used in carrying out their crimes and laundering the proceeds of these crimes. In this criminals have a serious information advantage. As Sun Tzu wrote in the Art of War, "If you know the enemy and yourself, you need not fear the result of
a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."</p>

<p>The Book is intended to reduce the criminals advantage, to alter the current imbalance and to get to know the criminal and his ways better. They provide money laundering prevention professionals, those that design, implement and test and for those that are also interested in combatting money laundering on a day to day basis with a comprehensive basis to improve both their understanding and ultimately improve effectiveness.</p>

<p>This Book is divided into <strong>2 Parts</strong> each divided into <strong>4 Sections</strong>, with, <strong>5 Recommendations to Effectively" combat Money Laundering; Money Laundering Facts and Figures;</strong> and <strong>What is Money Laundering?</strong> providing an introduction to Part 1.</p>

<p>In Part 1 the focus is on Crime related materials, covering (Sec 1) all predicate offences to money laundering; followed by (Sec 2) an in depth look at the various risk categories that pose an increased risk of money laundering for Banks and other Financial Institutions; for example covering Customer types, Countries, Products and Services and Channels; Important Laws and Regulations (Sec 3) and AML, Economic Sanctions, Anti-Bribery and Fraud Prevention Programme Design (Sec 4). In Part 2 the focus is on Crime related Cases with Regions, Countries, Criminals & Terrorists focussing on Regional and Country hotspots and profiling more than 250 of the most dangerous and deadly organised criminal gangs and terrorist groups (Sec 5); as well as details of the most reprehensible of terrorist attacks (Sec 6); followed by 150+ Leading Criminal Case Profiles (Sec 7) and finally 100+ Bank Enforcement case profiles.</p>

    <div itemprop="reviewBody"><img class="comma_open" src="/images/comma_open.png">For anyone wanting to delve into the background of financial crime and money laundering, this book is a fine starting point. John Cusack has assembled an amazing amount of information, from types of crime to particular threats faced by individual countries. I would have been a much better informed President of FATF if John's book had been available a few years ago.<img class="comma_close" src="/images/comma_close.png"></div>
